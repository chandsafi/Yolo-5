# Yolo-5
Gilgit Baltisan Road Detection using Yolo- 5 Deep Learning Model.

1. Introduction
1.1 Project Overview
This project involves detecting various types of road segments and characteristics across the Gilgit-Baltistan region. The aim is to classify different types of roads based on their unique attributes to assist with traffic and safety assessments in challenging terrains. Using YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, this project employs deep learning models for accurate object detection and classification.
1.2 Objectives
•	To create a labeled dataset for different road types.
•	To train an object detection model for real-time road type classification.
•	To evaluate the model's performance on a diverse dataset representative of the Gilgit-Baltistan region's road conditions.
2. Data Collection
2.1 Data Sources
Images were sourced from multiple roads in Gilgit-Baltistan, emphasizing segments that are frequently encountered, such as straight roads, turns, and damaged roads.
2.2 Data Collection Method
The data was collected using a combination of field photography and existing geographic datasets where available. Each road image was captured at various angles and lighting conditions to ensure diversity and robustness of the dataset. The images were stored in high resolution to retain details that are essential for road type classification.
